Because manual inspection is costly and low-efficient. In the  process of completing the inspection task, the inspection robot needs to solve problems  like autonomous positioning and path planning. Environment sensing technology is the  basis for solving the above problems. It is difficult for the inspection robot to accurately  understand the surroundings with laser-based sensing technology, while the environment  sensing based on scene semantic segmentation can more accurately assist the inspection  robot to complete tasks such as path planning and avoiding obstacles. However, there are  some challenges in substations. For example, there are categories with large ratio  difference between length and width, and the frequence of each category is significantly  different. Meanwhile, during the inspection task, the robot can encounter unseen  categories. These factors will seriously affect the accuracy of semantic segmentation. In  this paper, semantic segmentation of substation scenes is studied to improve the accuracy  of predicting seen and unseen categories. The main contents include:  (1) proposing a semantic segmentation model based on multi-view attention  mechanism to address some problems. For example, the shape of each category is  different, the ratio of length to width is different between categories, and the number of  some categories are also small. The model adopts atrous spatial pyramid pooling structure  and attention structure to extract different local visual features from image features and  strengthen the relationship between pixels of each category. At the same time, a multi- scale feature fusion method is designed to solve the problem of alignment and edge  information loss, which reduces the possibility of shadow phenomenon in the feature  fusion stage and improves the accuracy of substation scene recognition.  (2) proposing a zero-shot semantic segmentation model to predict unseen categories.  In order to learn the visual features of the unseen categories, the model contains a feature  generation method based on the autoencoder to generate the visual features of the unseen  class. At the same time, this method uses generative adversarial network technology to  reduce the gap between the generated visual features and the real visual features. The  model improves the accuracy of predicting unseen categories by simultaneously using  these two visual features for training.
